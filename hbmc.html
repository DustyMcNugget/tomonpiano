            <h1>Hi, everyone.</h1><b>This December 24th is Mary-Claire's 30th birthday.</b> As we will be just the two of us celebrating together in Penicuik, Scotland, I'd like to put together a video of family and friends sending heart-felt messages, exuberant well wishes and a spirited group performance of "Happy Birthday to You".
        </p>
            <b>Simply send a video</b> with a 5-10 second greeting message. It would be nice to have as many groups as possible so if you are in a family, with a partner or a flat-share, then a video of you all together would be great. Don't forget to include any pets. 
        <p>
            <b>Additionally,</b> if you are up for it, I'd love as many as possible singing along to "Happy Birthday". I have provided a <a href="https://youtu.be/x45jmXyEJn8"> backing track </a>on Youtube to sing to so we all sync up. Please observe the lyrics "...Happy Birthday <b><i>DEAR MARY-CLAIRE</b></i>...".
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>When recording the song,</b> if you are solo, please use headphones instead of your speaker to listen along to the track. This will help get the mixing right. Groups will need to use a speaker to all sing along together. If you play an instrument, feel free to play instead (or sing and play!), just be aware there will already be a piano accompaniment. Oh, and definitely use headphones if you are doing an instrumental recording.
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>
                <b>You can record</b> everything in one take or send more than one video as I'll take care of all the editing. 
            </p>
